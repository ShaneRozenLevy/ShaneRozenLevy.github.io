I am interested in leveraging my knowledge of dynamics and controls to create
robust behaviors in robots with interesting, and often times hybrid, 
dynamics. My dream is to find a way to combine the robustness to model 
errors that you get from a simple template based controller with the
robustness to physical disturbances that you get with an 
optimization based controller. I believe that to make a working robot,
it is crucial to test frequently on hardware, to not be afraid of
failure, and to learn from those failures.

Currently Iâ€™m working with the Penn Jerboa to study how we might take
advantage of both natural and man made hybrid transitions and
multipurpose appendages to control a highly underacted (4 motors and 12
degree of freedom), but power dense biped.
